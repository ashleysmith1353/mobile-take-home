# Scrollable Audio Streaming

This is an application that allows users to scroll through a list of audio clips, each associated with an image. The audio clips are from [SoundHelix](https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3).

## To Run the App
- Make sure you have `yarn` installed on your machine. If you do not, you can install yarn using Homebrew on Mac:
```
brew install yarn
```

- To run the app, please run:
```
yarn
```
And then:
```
yarn ios
```
Or
```
yarn android
```
These instructions assume you have set up XCode and have an iOS simulator as well as an Android simulator through Android Studio.
